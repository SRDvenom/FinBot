## 🚀 How It Works

FinBot combines these components:

1. **User Input**  
   FinBot receives a natural language query, like “What does P/E ratio mean?” or “How did the NASDAQ perform yesterday?”

2. **Processing Engine**  
   Using intelligent language models, FinBot interprets the intent and context of the question.

3. **Data Lookup & Logic**  
   If needed, FinBot fetches relevant financial data (from APIs, CSVs, or local datasets).

4. **Response Generation**  
   The bot returns a clear, human-style answer tailored to your query.
